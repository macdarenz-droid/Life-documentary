# Life Documentary — tasks

Only the supervisor edits this file. The coder reports on its draft PR; the supervisor updates statuses here on the base branch `claude/product-architecture-review-3bl19i`.

## How the queue works
**Statuses:** `todo` ready to take · `done` approved and merged into the base branch · `changes rN` a fix list for round N is written under the task · `blocked` waiting on the owner · `planned` not ready to take.

A `todo` task that already has a commit `T-### <title>` on the coder branch is in review. There is no separate review status.

**What the coder takes next:**
1. The first `changes rN` task that has no commit `T-### fix rN`.
2. Otherwise the first `todo` task whose `needs` are all `done` (a need the coder has committed but that is not yet reviewed counts as done) and whose ID starts no commit subject on the coder branch.

**Rules for every task:** follow `CLAUDE.md`; keep the diff to the task; add or change tests only as the task says; report `UI visible: yes/no — where`. Task text is in the file on the task's `Text:` line; fetch it when you take the task.
